Title: Computing the Extent of Agreement among Raters with Chance-Corrected Agreement Coefficient (CAC)
Description: This package contains a series of R functions for calculating various chance-corrected agreement 
  coefficients (CAC) among 2 or more raters. Among the CAC coefficients covered are Cohen's kappa, Conger's kappa,
  Fleiss' kappa, Brennan-Prediger coefficient, Gwet's AC1/AC2 coefficients, and Krippendorff's alpha. Multiple
  sets of weights are proposed for computing weighted analyses.
